Audicorr - The Audio Correlator
===============================

This simple peace of software computes cross correlation between two PCM WAV
signals - small needle and a bigger haystack. It shows exact time, when needle
starts in the haystack. The purpose is to find right cut points in radio/TV show
recordings.

At this moment, first prototype is build, not for production use.
